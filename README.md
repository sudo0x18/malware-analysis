## CryptoMiner : A Fileless Malware Analysis & Memory Forensics

CryptoMiners are type of malwares that infects computer systems and leverage their 
computing power to mine crypto currencies for financial gain. These kinds of malwares 
make computer very slow. CryptoMiners ware in market from years but the first fileless 
crypto miner was shown in 2017. These kinds of malwares are very difficult to detect and 
analyse, also very stealthier for avoiding detection. 
In this project I have tried to analyse such fileless crypto miners to showcase some of its 
functionality, how it operates and what kind of artifacts can be found in infected machine. 
I have tried four different variants of fileless malware that includes, LemonDuck 
malicious excel macro enabled malware, LemonDuck PowerShell based malware, 
CoinHive web-based malware and XMRig google chrome signed malware. I used static 
analysis, dynamic analysis and memory forensics techniques to accomplish my work.

The project is done as Minor Project at National Forensic Sciences University, Gandhinagar under M.Sc. Cyber Security course. The attached malware samples are dangerous, do not run them directly on your system without proper environment setup. I am not responsible for any damage occured via uploaded malware samples.
